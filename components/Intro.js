            <h3>About Me</h3>

            <p>I'm a Software Engineer. I grew up in Hong Kong and moved to London in 2018.</p>

            <p>
                I love writing clean and maintainable code. I insist on writing tests first.
                Backend development is my specialty although I also occasionally work on front-ends.

                I was a Java developer by trade but I now work with all sorts of technologies.
        </p>

            <p>
                I enjoy working with LLMs, doing DevOps work on CI/CD and containerisation. I'm passionate about
                creating the best developer experience. I'm also trying to get into public speaking 
                and writing.
            </p>

            <p>
                In my free time I enjoy running. I'm a big fan of IoT devices and home automation, 
                literally obsessed with any gadgets that can sync with my phone.
